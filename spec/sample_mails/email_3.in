---------------------------------------------------------------------

After days of not getting better faster enough, and some significant
downturns (meaning a lot more pain in a few places) I decided to see a
doc. 10 hours later 3've had blood drawn, peed in cups, xrays, seen a
series of doctors and nurses, and now I'm being held overnight for
observation with an IV of antibiotics and anti inflams and fluids.

Current diagnosis is ?. There is much head scratching. 3t seems to not
be exactly my back as the worst pain is now in my pelvis and neck.

Next up is more docs either this eve or in the morning.

Overall I'm okay and so long as I don't move I don't hurt as much. : )

I'll let yall know what I know when I know it.

Peter
